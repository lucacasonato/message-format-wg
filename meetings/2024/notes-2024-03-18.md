## Topic: AOB?

====

Report on the ICU implementation status from TIM and MIH.


### PR #718: [FEEDBACK] The data model could be simplified for declarations #718

Merged

### PR #728: Add Resolved Values section to formatting #728

MIH: I don’t know if this PR touches how functions get “chained”
We should specify the behavior, how options are merged (or not), etc.

ECH: this was also discussed in the ICU TC meeting as underspecified.

APP: please take a look

### PR #731: Disallow whitespace as the first character of a reserved-body in a reserved-statement.

APP: I articulated some principles on how we deal with spaces. But we allow “reserved” to treat spaces as it wishes.

MIH: maybe should be addressed together with issue #635, “Some red flags with the current grammar for reserved-statement”

APP: Also see #725, I think we have a model on how we treat spaces “outside of things”

APP: compare #730 and #731, see which one we take to solve the ambiguity of spaces around reserved body

### PR #732: Fix #726: remove :time/:datetime compose test

Merged

===

#706


MIH: currently ICU can’t both return a formatted value, and an error
For example for this input : "Hello {$user}"

If "user" is not available at runtime we can either return a fallback string ("Hello {$user}"), or an error.
But you can't do both.

EAO: This is an offshoot of #706

APP: we should add the error names. And define behavior better. Later.

### #586 Normative requirements for markup handling

Move to LDML 46.

### #711: LDML45 Acknowledgements List

---

Can we start discussion on data model changes now?

APP: I would rather not make changes until 45 is shipped. Design documents, yes.

TIM: I think that #718 should have a design document.

MIH: I think a design document on the data model would be good, but only after we collect all the feedback from the implementations.

### #709: Syntactic ambiguity with `identifier` production

TIM: fine to close

Meeting next week, probably skip the one in 2 weeks (April 1)
